# Biathlon Laser Shooting

This repository contains an Arduino project to setup laser shooting stations for non professional biathlon competions.
The initial release contains exclusively the first revision of .ino files used to validate e2e the shooting experience.

In the follow up commits, I will share the design of my solution, 3D models of the components I printed, and the circuit
schemes.
